The poet is a pretender.
Pretend so completely
Who even pretends to be pain
The pain you must feel.

And those who read what he writes,
In the pain dealt I felt good,
Not the two he had,
But only the one they don't have.

And so on the wheel rails
Spins, an entertain reason,
That rope train
What is called the heart.
